# gatsby-starter-tachyons
Updated to Gatsby 2.0.

A simple integration using [gatsby-starter-default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/) for CSS

Make sure you have the Gatsby CLI installed. You can do that by running
`npm install --global gatsby-cli`

To install a new site with the Gatsby-Starter-Tachyons simply run:

`gatsby new [SITE_DIRECTORY] https://github.com/pixelsign/gatsby-starter-tachyons`

This downloads the files and initializes the site by running `npm install`

Then you can go to the newly created folder and run
`gatsby develop`
Your newly built site is now running on your localhost, and you can start building it. 

Make sure you read the documentation on both Gatsby and Tachyons. And have fun!
